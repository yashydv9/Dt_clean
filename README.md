# Dt_clean
My first project on data cleaning.

We made following changes in the dataset - 
1. Standardized the columns using trim function.
2. Standardized the Sale date.
3. Populated the null values in Property_address column.
4. Broke Property_address into individual columns.
5. Broke out OwnerAddress into individual columns (Address,City,State).
6. Changed 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No' respectively.
7. Deleted the duplicated columns.
