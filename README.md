# Dt_clean
My first project on data cleaning.

We made following changes in the dataset - 
Standardized the columns using trim function.
Standardized the Sale date.
Populated the null values in Property_address column.
Broke Property_address into individual columns.
Broke out OwnerAddress into individual columns (Address,City,State).
Changed 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No' respectively.
Deleted the duplicated columns.
